# Venture_Capital_Investment

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Introduction/Description
With the eminence of the startup space often led by 'Unicorns', there is a great 
opportunity to explore and dissect key factors facilitating their success/failure. 
In that regard, we will work on a dataset containing investment information of 50k+ 
startups around the world. In light of recent trends, we could formulate a handful of hypothesis 
as the following:
* What are the top 3 key determining factors affecting the status of the company? In other words, 
what keeps them operating, lead them to acquisition, or closure?
* What are the industries with the highest level of acquisitions? What are the markets with 
a greater proportion of exits?
* Though the US will have a high number of startup and traffic, how does the investment landscape
look in other countries?
* How did the startups's financiang evolve over time since their inception?
* What are the markets with the highest number of failed startups (status - closed)?

In the attempt to answet those questions, we will work on the project starting by  
prepping the data to feed into an EDA. This will help hone our questions and build a 
more robust hypothesis to guide us in our investigation. Equipped with those, we will embark
on the stage of modeling/feature engineering with a final step being data visualization. 

We sourced the dataset on the Kaggle and from the author, it was webscrapped 
from the Crunchbase (a reputed platform to obtain information pertaining to startup investment).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
