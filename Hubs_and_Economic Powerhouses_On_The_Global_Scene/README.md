# Hubs_and_Economic_Powerhouses_Around the World

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
With the rise of globalization, countries, and more specifically cities/regions have been honing their competitive advantage by specializing in one or a couple of economic activities. In doing so, they built a noteworthy reputation giving them leverage in attracting both human and physical capital supporting and driving their growth. Some good examples are  New York in finance, Shenzhen in manufacturing, and San Francisco in Technology. In face of this division of labour across the global economy offers, there is an opportunity to investigate the historical background, the political environment, and the role of those hubs in the greater economic role in their respective countries. It is our hope to shed light on the factors and their relationships breeding certain economic activities to better evaluate burgeoning cities in emerging economies.
